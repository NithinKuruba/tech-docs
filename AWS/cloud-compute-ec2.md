## Basics

- When EC2 instance is running, price charged per hour and not when stopped

- 4 dimensions for each instance type
  - vCPUs
  - Memory
  - Storage
  - Network Performance

- The ratio of vCPU to memory is constant and scale linearly as well as the price per hour

- Families
  - c4 compute optimized
  - r3 memory optimized
  - i2 storage optimized
  - G2 graphics optimized
