# IAM - Identity and Access Management

## Users and Groups

- IAM is a global service
- Root account is created by default
- Users can be created and can be grouped
- Users can be part of multiple groups
- Groups can only contain users but not groups
- Users and groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
- AWS suggests us to use `least privilege principle`, that is to provide only required permissions

## Policies

### Types

- Group policies
- Inline Policies
- Password Policies

### Policy Structure

- Sid: statement identifier
- Effect: Allow, Deny
- Principal: Account/User/Role
- Actions
- Resources
- Conditions

## Access Keys

- Access keys are used if we intend to use AWS CLI or AWS SDK
- They can be generated through AWS management console
- Once generated, they are not saved so if we lose it then we need to re-generate them
- We can download the access kys in a `.csv` file

### Configuring CLI

```bash
aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: dhaoisufhoaifhoe
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: aiodfhisfhosefh
Default region name [None]: canada-central
Default output format [None]:
## Testing
aws iam list-users
```
