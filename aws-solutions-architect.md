# AWS

## IAM - Identity and Access Management 

### Users and Groups

* IAM is a global service
* Root account is created by default
* Users can be created and can be grouped
* Users can be part of multiple groups
* Groups can only contain users but not groups
* Users and groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
* AWS suggests us to use `least privilege principle`, that is to provide only required permissions

### Policies

* Users can get group policies and inline policies
